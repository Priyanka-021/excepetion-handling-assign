        "**2. What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  In python an exception is an event that occurs during programme execution that disrupts the regular flow of code. for the flow of code in python there use some error catching code to handel these exception.\n",

        "   \n",
        "   Every object in Python has a reference count. When you create a new reference to an object, the count goes up. When a reference is deleted, the count goes down. When the count hits zero, Python knows it’s safe to delete the object from memory\n",

        "\n",
        "   The file.read() method reads the entire contents of the file at once and returns it as a string. It can also take an optional argument specifying how many bytes (or characters) you want to read from the file.\n",
        "   The file.readline() method reads one line from the file at a time and returns it as a string. If you call readline() multiple times, it reads the next line each time until the end of the file is reached.\n",

        "    \n",

        "**22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "   The os module in Python is a powerful utility that provides a way to interact with the operating system. When it comes to file handling, the os module offers several functions for managing files and directories, such as creating, removing, renaming files, and working with file paths.\n",
        "   The os module allows you to perform file and directory operations that interact with the underlying operating system. It's especially useful for tasks that go beyond just opening and reading files, like checking file existence, changing file permissions, or traversing directories.\n",

        "**23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n",
        "   \n",

        "**25.Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Multithreading is important in certain applications because it allows a program to perform multiple tasks at the same time (concurrently), leading to better performance, responsiveness, and efficient resource usage—especially when dealing with I/O-bound tasks."
